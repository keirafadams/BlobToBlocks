# BlobToBlocks
Computational storage tools for communication higher level storage concepts (files, objects, etc), opcodes, and arguments, to block level storage.

This work is inspired by [Intel Labs "Virtual Objects" concepts](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/hotstorage19-paper-adams.pdf).

This tool chain is intended to provide client libraries in a variety of languages so that users may create compute decriptors (in labs parlance) describing the low level layout of a file or other data storage object that can then be communicated to block storage targets, such as NVMeOF servers, in a transport agnostic fashion.

Take a look at [our WiKi](https://github.com/keirafadams/BlobToBlocks/wiki) for more details as this develops/
