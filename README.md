# BlobToBlocks
Computational storage tools for communication higher level storage concepts (files, objects, etc), opcodes, and arguments, to block level storage.

This work is inspired by Intel Labs "Virtual Objects" concepts.

This tool chain is intended to provide client libraries in a variety of languages so that users may create compute decriptors (in labs parlance) describing the low level layout of a file or other data storage object that can then be communicated to block storage targets, such as NVMeOF servers, in a transport agnostic fashion.

Obviously this is currently very early work, and who knows, may be abandoned precipitously
